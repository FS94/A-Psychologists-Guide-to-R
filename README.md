# A-Psychologists-Guide-to-R
This is a repository containing the course notes and worked examples for a six week course in the R statistical programming language taught at the University of Melbourne, Australia. It is designed for graduate students and faculty in psychology (and other social sciences) with no programming experience, and covers the use of R from the basics up to multilevel modelling.
